    "$$u'(t)=5u(t)+2\\ u(0)=0$$\n",
    "we want to know what is other value of u(t), we take many many small steps and use taylor expansion to calculate step by step:\n",
    "$$u(\\frac{1}{2})=u(0)+\\frac{1}{2}u'(0)$$\n",
    "and then we can calculate u(1) in next step.\n",

    "the same method also can be applied to PDE.\n",
