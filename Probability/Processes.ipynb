    "## Bernoulli Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence of independent Bernoulli trial. Each trial is a binomial distribution.\n",
    "So we already have lots of conclusion for Bernoulli Process, e.g. it's expectation and variance, also the property of independent for each trial and memoryless.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a conclusion, for number of success in n stage has binomial PMF, for interarrival times has geometric PMF, Time to k arrivals has pascal PMF which is $C_{n-1}^{k-1}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we need to emphasize an important point for Bernoulli process: A process is Bernoulli process only if we only have previous information, not future information, if we know any information, then it's not a Bernoulli Process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example to demonstrate it is: What is the expectation of the length of the first consecutive tails in coin toss.\n",
    "\n",
    "This question seems can be regarded as when will the first head appear(geometric distribution), because of memoryless. But we need to think about which part of the process has a geometric distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$XXXOOOOXXO$$\n",
    "is it:\n",
    "$$...BBBBB..$$\n",
    "or\n",
    "$$....BBBB..$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer should be the second. Why the first one is not? Because we don't know what will happen in the future, and current result is head. if we say next toss is the start of geo distribution process, that mean we already know next toss is tail. the second is Bernoulli process because the current toss is tail, we can make sure our process is same as first head appear problem."

    "## Poisson Process\n",
    "We can regard Poisson process as a continuous Bernuolli process, and it the stage in Bernoulli process equals to extremely small time period $\\delta$. Because of the time period is so small, there are only one event can happen in this time interval, so we only have two scenarios, one is event happens, the other is event does not happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Poisson process also has indenpendent property that is numbers of arrivals in disjoint time intervals are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a $\\lambda$ as arrival rate which gives $\\lambda \\delta$ as the probability of event happens in a small time interval. In other word, arrival rate $\\lambda$ is the number of arrivals in unit time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our number of arrivals in time $t$ problem has probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(k, t) = lim_{n->\\infty}C_n^k(\\lambda \\delta)^k(1-\\lambda \\delta)^{n-k}$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "$$t=n\\delta\\ \\ p=\\lambda \\delta$$\n",
    "then:\n",
    "$$P(k, t) = lim_{n->\\infty}C_n^k(\\frac{\\lambda t}{n})^k(1-\\frac{\\lambda t}{n})^{n-k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(k, t) = \\frac{(\\lambda t)^ke^{-\\lambda t}}{k!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the expectation of number of success in time t for Poisson process is $\\lambda t$ and the expectation of the time when the first success happens is $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$, this two are from the defination of arrival rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Time to kth arrival problem has PDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(t) \\delta = P(k-1,t)\\lambda \\delta$$\n",
    "$$f(t) = \\frac{(\\lambda t)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!}e^{-\\lambda t}\\lambda$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When k = 1, this is a exponential distribution, which has the same shape as geometric distribution in Bernuolli process.\n",

    "#### Poisson fishing\n",
    "Poisson goes to fish poisson, the arrival rate is $\\lambda$. He will fish for 2 hours and go home if he get at least 1 poisson, otherwise he will continue to fish until he get one.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. what is the prob for fishing for more than 2 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "2. what is the prob for fishing for more than 2 hours and less than 5 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "3. what is the prob for catching at least 2 poissons\n",
    "\n",
    "4. what is the E of number of fish\n",
    "$$\\lambda t + P(0, 2)*1$$\n",
    "5. what is the E of total fishing time\n",
    "\n",
    "6. what is the E of fishing time after fishing for 4 hours and catching nothing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### blub burn out\n",
    "Having three blub, the burning out event has exponential distribution with arrival rate as $\\lambda$. what is the expectation of time when we observe the first time of burning out? what is the expectation of time when all blubs burn out?\n",
    "\n",
    "$$min(X, Y, Z) = \\frac{1}{3\\lambda}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$max(X, Y, Z) = \\frac{1}{3\\lambda} +\\frac{1}{2\\lambda}+\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a poisson process with 3 underlying poisson process, when the first blub die, we have a new poisson with 2 underlying, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observation bias\n",
    "\n",
    "the central idea is the oberservation and the expectation calculation are from different angle. for example, a survey shows the average family has 4 people, but another survey shows people are in a family with average size 6. what cause the difference? This is because of the first survey has target as each family and the second has target as people. for the second survey, it very likely to interview a people who is in a large family rather than a small one, so the bias happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Same reason for waiting for bus. Bus company say their bus arrival obey poisson and with arrival rate $\\lambda$, so the average waiting time should be $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$, but in reality, customers always ask others how long time does the bus not appear and count for his own waiting time and finally find the total waiting time is longer than what the company said. This is because customers has more possibility coming into the larger interval thana small one. If customer always come as the exactly same poisson process, which is coming after a bus goes away, then they will see the same expectation as the company said.  "
